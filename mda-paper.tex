% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart
We consider tools for developing information systems with extensive use of Linked Open Data technologies (LOD) \cite{Bizer}.  The LOD technologies allows software designers to develop program systems data integrated by means of common ontologies and web protocols \cite{Cherk}.  An application of semantic models at run time \cite{Kopay} allowed software designers to partially cope with problem of requirements and data structure evolution in lifespan of information systems.  A part of system configuration (static or dynamic) is build on domain ontology model interpretation, thus modifying information system behavior, resulting in a wider flexibility of system functioning.

The present research deals with developing software instrumental tools for general design of information systems using both Model Driven Architecture (MDA) and LOD \cite{MDA}.  MDA Platform Independent Model (PIM) is expressed as set of UML diagrams (Class Diagram, State Diagram, \emph{etc.}).  The model form a \verb~namespace~ of a LOD graph.  All the PIM entities (MOF structures) are defined as ontology resources, \emph{i.e.} with URI references to LOD terms.  This allows us to translate PIM UML model to set of triples and store them in an ontology warehouse for further transformation into a Platform Specific Model (PSM).

The \verb~ClioPatria~ ontology server and the SWI Prolog language \cite{Clio} are used as tools of MDA model querying and processing.

One of the problem of tools construction of such kind is the absence of visual editors of UML supporting ontology models.  The UML 2.4 standard implicitly suggests coupling stereotypes and tag values forming a data format representing stereotype aspects of the UML entities.  Thus, one of the research direction is to construct new or adapt existing UML modeling tool to support LOD in UML diagrams.

Linked Open Data (LOD) [1] technology has been suggested by W3C consortium to represent the semantic information in the published web content in a way that provides not only the possibility of its processing with software agents (Semantic Web), but also to link all available information into a single semantic graph using relations and global universal identifiers (URIs) of resources. The descriptive capabilities of semantic web technologies, HTML5 document publishing tools, and LOD technologies form an infrastructural basis of authoring and publishing documents. The document is constructed out of individual parts (text and images) that are loaded from other servers with links to relevant resources. The resources represent both the static content and text content as a result of a data conversion algorithm execution. The LOD provide a logical markup for the information presented in a document, informative basis for the different variants of visual representation and interpretation, logical connections with other documents, export information into other documents, procedural processing, etc. An important advantage of LOD usage in information environments is a weakening of the requirements to the information warehouses: the document itself is a formalized data warehouse. In some extent, this allows reallocation of the time spent on designing the database structure for storage of partially formalized documents to the process of solving a domain problem: the user (developer) markups the document text data with semantic meaning.

The aim of the study is to design an approach to the development of software performing the functions of authoring and typesetting documents marked up according to LOD principles. To achieve the goal, a set of server functions and client (web-browser) JavaScript routines has been developed that allows user to create documents with web browser. The functions support uploading of text fragments from other documents and their generation with server and client scripts. The resulting document is stored in the data warehouse, printed or downloaded to the user workstation as an HTML file. JavaScript implements various document views, e.g., as an input form; text part conversions, e.g., leaning nouns and substituting pronouns.

The created editing tools are the basis of developed digital archives of documents intended for solving problems of creating documentation of university courses, representing research results of DNA/RNA sequencing. The use of LOD data formats, HTML processing tools of web browser and developed technologies allow one to solve a wide class of problems of formation of documentation, ranging from the formation of a meaningful part of the texts through the presentation of stylistic characteristics of the texts and the integration of logical markup into a global data access services.

The development of the tools for document representation on the basis of LOD are aimed at the formation of the prototype of a global environment that supports automation of data transfer between documents of several companies, and creates, ideally, a distributed document processing environment with the principles of social networks. The task is relevant especially in some small business environments with no well-established information flows and relationships between documents. This is mainly due to the dynamism and diversity of the small business. Use of large-scale workflow automation software in the environments of such kind requires large financial expenses for the purchase and continuous improvement of the software product. Moreover, in companies with a deployed a document flow automation, there is almost always a wide class of documents, which are not integrated in the main document flow (e.g., memos, statements), documents with difficult-to-formalize information (e.g., job descriptions) and the documents received by the organizations from the outside having no logical markup (e.g., industry standards).
This work continues the research outlined in [2] in implementing client services operating on the platform of the web browser.


\section{Transformation software architecture}
\label{sec:arch}

The architecture of the system is presented in Fig. 1 (all relations shown in the figure are bidirectional). The document is downloaded from a server where it is composed from a content stored in a database or a file system, results of an algorithmic data conversion of other sources, and elements of a template that includes the user view interface elements and interpretation modules on the displayed page. In the formation of the final form of the document, interpretation modules request the required data and resources on the source server or other Internet servers.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering

  \caption{The general architecture of the PIM transformation system}
  \label{fig:arch}
\end{figure}


Interpretation modules of the semantic markup are implemented with client-side JavaScript. They are executed as soon as the main content is loaded by the browser. The modules scan the tree structure of the document, recognizing the conditions of their activation. If the scan was successful, the body of the module is executed, changing of the document content (tree structure). The document composition finalizes as soon as all conditions were met and all commands activated.

A database of the system is a set of tools for storing and serving multi-format data. The body of the document loaded at the first stage is stored in XML (XHTML) files in the file system on the server. The file system is wrapped with a document versions tracking layer to monitor the document dynamics and create integrated backup copies. This level is quite easy to be implemented using modern version control systems like GIT or Subversion.

In order to organize standard SPARQL data source access and full-text search, storage components for the logical layer and related data as a graph of triples have been developing. ClioPatria [4] and Jena are the component implementations. The first system is interesting because it is implemented entirely with the programming languages Prolog and C. It supports several formats of compact storage of data, and tight integration of triple data with the runtime and language environment of Prolog. A regulated access to the triples from JavaScript is supported using special Pengines protocol [5]. There are a number of implementation libraries for the protocols for popular programming languages, including client-side JavaScript, Java, Python. As an alternative, Java-based Jena library can be used for the service realization.

A full-text index is provided by Elasticsearch indexing engine. The implementation of the index service is simple enough because any RDF graph is representable as JSON (JSON-LD) document, JSON is the main format of storage of indexed information in ElasticSearch. For the representation of the documents to the user as a search result on the page, some triples must be marked as representative of the result. Elasticsearch has the means of fuzzy comparison of terms that allows construction of relevant information search engines. The general technical aspects of the module functioning are discussed later in the application section.

% Watch out that the combined width of all the subfigures on a
% line do not exceed the text width or a line break will occur.

% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat[]), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.
% Be aware that for subfig.sty to generate the (a), (b), etc., subfigure
% labels, the optional argument to \subfloat must be present. If a
% subcaption is not desired, just leave its contents blank,
% e.g., \subfloat[].


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table and, given that table
% captions serve much like titles, are usually capitalized except for words
% such as a, an, and, as, at, but, by, for, in, nor, of, on, or, the, to
% and up, which are usually not capitalized unless they are the first or
% last word of the caption. Table text will default to \footnotesize as
% IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that the IEEE does not put floats in the very first column
% - or typically anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also,
% in-text middle ("here") positioning is typically not used, but it
% is allowed and encouraged for Computer Society conferences (but
% not Computer Society journals). Most IEEE journals/conferences use
% top floats exclusively.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals/conferences, places
% footnotes above bottom floats. This can be corrected via the
% \fnbelowfloat command of the stfloats package.
